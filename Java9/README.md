##### Java 9 Features
- `JShell:` Interactive shell tool which allows us to execute Java code and get immediate results. Just like Python shell.
            In `Intellij`, if you have `JDK > 8`, then you can open `JShell` by `Tools -> JShell Console`. It lets you test the 
            code without writing the whole class.
